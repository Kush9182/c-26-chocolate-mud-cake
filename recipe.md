step 1- Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Line the base of a 22 - 23 cm spring-form tin with non-stick baking paper and spray with non-stick baking spray.

step 2- Mix the lemon juice with the Fresh Milk and set aside for it to sour the milk.

step 3- Place oil, chocolate and hot coffee in a microwave bowl or small saucepan and heat gently, stirring often, until chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Cool.

step 4- In a large bowl, mix the Standard Grade Flour, Baking Soda, Baking Powder, Low GI Sugar or Raw Sugar and cocoa.

step 5- Mix the eggs and soured milk into the cooled chocolate mixture, combine thoroughly, and then whisk into the dry ingredients.

step 6- Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 1 hour. 

step 7- When tested, fudgy crumbs will still adhere to a skewer. This is the desirable sticky mud cake consistency. 

step 8- Cool for 15 minutes in the tin, then turn out and cool further on a wire rack.
